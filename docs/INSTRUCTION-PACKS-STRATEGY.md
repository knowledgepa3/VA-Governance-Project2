# ACE Instruction Packs - Dual-Use Strategy

**Purpose:** Instruction Packs serve as both **internal training** for the ACE platform and **external marketing** material for prospects.

---

## The Three Core Instruction Packs

| Pack | Internal Use | External Use | Price |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **ECV Protocol** | Evidence integrity enforcement | Technical whitepaper, credibility | $2,500/yr |
| **MAI Framework** | Core governance engine | Differentiator in proposals | $3,000/yr |
| **Audit Defense** | Red team scenarios | BD/sales enablement | $3,500/yr |

## 1. ECV Protocol (Evidence Chain Verification)

### The Technical Manual

**What it teaches ACE:**
- Source grounding methodology
- Citation mapping requirements
- Cross-verification rules
- Confidence scoring
- Provenance trail generation

**What it shows prospects:**
> "Every fact the system produces has a direct, unbroken chain back to the original source document."

**Marketing angle:** Technical credibility. Shows you understand forensic-grade evidence requirements.

**Key policies:**
- `ecv-source-required` - MANDATORY: All claims need sources
- `ecv-cross-verify-critical` - MANDATORY: Critical claims need multiple sources
- `ecv-no-hallucination` - MANDATORY: Block ungrounded outputs
- `ecv-citation-freshness` - ADVISORY: Warn on stale citations

---

## 2. MAI Framework (Mandatory/Advisory/Informational)

### The Governance Rulebook

**What it teaches ACE:**
- Behavioral classification system
- Runtime enforcement patterns
- Override workflows with justification
- Drift detection methodology

**What it shows prospects:**
> "Governance is enforced at runtime—so the system stays auditable and controllable even as the underlying models change."

**Marketing angle:** Core differentiator. This is what makes ACE different from "just AI."

**Key policies:**
- `mai-no-auth-bypass` - MANDATORY: No authentication circumvention
- `mai-human-approval-submissions` - MANDATORY: Human approval for external actions
- `mai-scope-boundary` - MANDATORY: Stay within authorized scope
- `mai-low-confidence-review` - ADVISORY: Review uncertain outputs
- `mai-drift-detection` - INFORMATIONAL: Monitor behavioral changes

---

## 3. Audit Defense (Why Agents Fail)

### The BD Urgency Creator

**What it teaches ACE:**
- Audit simulation scenarios
- Gap identification patterns
- Remediation workflows
- Evidence packaging

**What it shows prospects:**

> "The 5 Questions That Kill AI Deployments"
> 1. Show me the decision trail
> 2. Prove this data is real
> 3. Who approved this action?
> 4. What rules governed this?
> 5. Has behavior changed over time?

**Marketing angle:** Creates urgency. Shows prospects their current AI is a liability.

**Key policies:**
- `audit-decision-chain` - MANDATORY: Document all decisions
- `audit-hash-chain` - MANDATORY: Tamper-evident logs
- `audit-no-mock-production` - MANDATORY: Real data only
- `audit-behavioral-baseline` - ADVISORY: Monitor for drift
- `audit-readiness-check` - INFORMATIONAL: Weekly self-assessment

## Future Instruction Packs (Roadmap)

| Pack | Purpose | Price |
|------|---------|-------|
| **PII Shield** | Advanced PII detection and redaction | $2,000/yr |
| **Export Control** | ITAR/EAR compliance for AI outputs | $3,000/yr |
| **Bias Detection** | Algorithmic bias monitoring | $2,500/yr |
| **Incident Response** | AI incident handling procedures | $2,000/yr |

## Summary

These aren't just features—they're **intellectual property** that happens to come with enforcement tooling.

**The pattern:**
1. Develop methodology internally
2. Codify as Instruction Pack
3. Use for ACE platform training
4. Extract for marketing materials
5. Sell as standalone module

Each pack pays for itself in marketing value before a single customer buys it.
