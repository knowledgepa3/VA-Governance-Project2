# ACE Platform
## Governed AI for Veterans Affairs

---

### The Challenge

VA processes **3+ million claims annually** with significant backlog. AI can help, but federal deployment requires:
- Complete audit trails
- Human oversight of decisions
- Protection against AI failures
- Regulatory compliance

**Most AI solutions add governance as an afterthought. ACE was built governance-first.**

---

### The Solution

**ACE (Automated Compliance Engine)** is a multi-agent AI platform that combines powerful automation with the oversight federal agencies require.
