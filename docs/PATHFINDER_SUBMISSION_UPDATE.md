## Original Submission
AI-powered redaction and document processing for VHA

## Updated Capabilities (Significant Enhancement)

Since our initial submission, we have developed a comprehensive **governed multi-agent AI platform** called ACE (Automated Compliance Engine) that directly addresses VA's AI modernization priorities.

---

## Product: ACE Platform

### What It Does

ACE is a multi-agent AI orchestration platform that provides:

1. **Claims Processing Automation**
   - Automated evidence extraction from service records and medical documentation
   - AI-assisted service connection analysis with 38 CFR regulatory citation
   - CUE (Clear and Unmistakable Error) detection in prior decisions
   - Audit-ready Evidence Chain Validation reports

2. **Trustworthy AI Governance**
   - Human-in-the-loop approval gates for all consequential actions
   - Complete audit trails with per-action telemetry
   - Continuous adversarial testing (Adversarial Assurance Lane)
   - Cryptographic assurance contracts documenting system integrity

3. **VA API Integration**
   - VA Lighthouse API integration (Claims, Verification, Benefits Intake)
   - VBMS-compliant document formatting
   - OAuth2 authentication ready

## Alignment with VA AI Strategy

| VA FY2026 AI Goal | ACE Capability |
|-------------------|----------------|
| AI-assisted claims adjudication | VA Claims Workforce with evidence analysis |
| Model auditability | Adversarial Assurance Lane + audit trails |
| Responsible AI deployment | MAI classification with human oversight gates |
| 10 new AI use cases | 5 workforce templates ready (VA Claims, Clinical, Cyber, Financial, Grants) |
| Workflow redesign with AI | Multi-agent orchestration architecture |

---

## Key Differentiator

**Built by an ISSO, for federal compliance.**

Unlike AI solutions that add governance as an afterthought, ACE was designed governance-first by an Information System Security Officer with 17 years of federal experience. Every architectural decision prioritizes:
- Auditability
- Human oversight
- Reproducibility
- Adversarial resilience
