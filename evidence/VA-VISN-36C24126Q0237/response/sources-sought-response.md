## 3. Technical Approach

ACE Consulting proposes to support the VA's VISN Radiology AI initiative through the following technical approach:

### 3.1 Authority to Operate (ATO) Support

Our core strength is navigating the federal ATO process. For the VA's AI radiology platform, we would provide:

**Pre-Authorization Phase:**
- Security categorization per FIPS 199
- Control selection aligned with VHA Handbook 6500.6
- Inheritance analysis for VA common controls
- Privacy impact assessment support

**Authorization Package Development:**
- System Security Plan (SSP) development
- Security Control Assessment (SCA) coordination
- POA&M development and tracking
- Risk Assessment Report preparation
- Continuous monitoring strategy

**VA-Specific Requirements:**
- Alignment with VA Directive 6500
- VHA 6500.6 compliance mapping
- VHIE interconnection documentation if applicable
- Integration requirements for Vista Imaging/PACS

### 3.2 AI Governance Compliance

For FDA-approved AI radiology solutions, additional governance considerations include:

- NIST AI RMF alignment for clinical AI applications
- Human oversight and intervention requirements
- Algorithmic bias assessment framework
- Performance monitoring and drift detection
- Audit trail and explainability documentation

### 3.3 Integration Security Support

**VA Systems Integration:**
- Security requirements for PACS integration
- Vista Imaging security boundary analysis
- EMHR interconnection security controls
- Data classification and handling requirements

## 4. Teaming Strategy

Given the specialized nature of FDA-approved radiology AI, ACE Consulting would pursue a teaming arrangement:

### Proposed Teaming Structure

| Role | Entity | Responsibility |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Prime/Security Lead** | ACE Consulting | ATO, security compliance, RMF, governance |
| **AI Technology Partner** | FDA-approved AI Vendor (TBD) | Clinical AI platform, FDA clearance, clinical workflows |
| **Integration Partner** | VA PACS Specialist (TBD) | Vista Imaging integration, PACS connectivity |

### ACE Value as Teaming Partner

For FDA-approved AI vendors seeking VA contracts, ACE provides:

1. **Federal ATO Expertise** - Most commercial AI vendors lack federal security authorization experience
2. **VA-Specific Knowledge** - Understanding of VHA 6500.6, Vista systems, VA security requirements
3. **Small Business Status** - Enables set-aside participation
4. **Cleared Personnel** - Top Secret clearance for sensitive healthcare IT work

## 5. Capability Statement

### Core Competencies Relevant to This Requirement

| Capability | Experience Level | Direct Relevance |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| RMF/ATO Authorization | Expert (10+ years) | **HIGH** - Core requirement for VA AI deployment |
| ISSO Services | Expert | **HIGH** - Ongoing security management |
| AI Governance | Advanced | **HIGH** - NIST AI RMF implementation |
| Federal Healthcare IT | Intermediate | **MEDIUM** - VA-specific requirements |
| PACS/Medical Imaging | Would require teaming | **LOW** - Partner brings this capability |

## 6. Questions for the Government

To better inform our response to any subsequent solicitation, we respectfully request clarification on:

1. **ATO Inheritance:** Will the AI platform be authorized as a standalone system, or will it inherit VA common controls? What is the expected authorization boundary?

2. **Teaming Preference:** Does the VA prefer responses from integrated teams (AI vendor + security support), or separate responses for technology vs. compliance services?

3. **FDA Clearance Requirement:** Is a specific FDA clearance class required (510(k), De Novo, PMA)? Are CE-marked international solutions acceptable?

4. **Contract Vehicle:** Is the VA considering use of existing contract vehicles (VETS2, T4NG, GSA MAS) or a new competitive procurement?

5. **Timeline:** What is the expected timeline from solicitation release to award? What is the desired operational deployment date?

6. **Set-Aside Determination:** Is this anticipated to be a Total Small Business set-aside? Are there specific socioeconomic categories under consideration (SDVOSB, WOSB)?
