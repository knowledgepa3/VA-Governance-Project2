    "separateRatings": "A veteran can receive SEPARATE ratings for instability (DC 5257) AND limitation of motion (DC 5260/5261) in the same knee per VAOPGCPREC 23-97 and 9-98. This is commonly missed by VA raters.",
    "separateFlexionExtension": "Per VAOPGCPREC 9-2004, separate ratings can be assigned for limitation of flexion (DC 5260) and limitation of extension (DC 5261) of the same knee joint.",
    "bilateralFactor": "If both knees are affected, the bilateral factor (38 CFR 4.26) adds 10% to the combined value of bilateral disabilities.",
    "painfulMotion": "Per 38 CFR 4.59, painful motion of a major joint warrants at least the minimum compensable rating (10%) even if range of motion is technically full.",
    "flareUps": "Examiners must estimate additional functional loss during flare-ups per DeLuca v. Brown and Sharp v. Shulkin."
